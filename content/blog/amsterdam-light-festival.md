## The Trip

In January this year, I went to the Netherlands over a weekend to see the [Light Festival](https://amsterdamlightfestival.com/en) and visit Rotterdams [MiniWorld](https://www.miniworldrotterdam.com/EN_index.html).

Now, do I recommend going to most places in central and norther Europe during the winter months? **NO!** It's so cold and icy!
And Amsterdam was icy! We slipped and skidded all over the place. But, finally, we got on the boat and began the cruise to  see the Light Festival. Let's see some photos:

## Amsterdams at Night
Lets begin by looking at some general photos I took of Amsterdam at night.

The Trams were a great way to get around!

You can probably already feel the cold chills blowing from the images.

If you haven't figured it out already, I love photographing in Black and White. It give a timeless feel to the photos.

They have some really cool wall artists around these parts. We saw several impressive pieces of wall art when we walked around the city.

Okay, so this one aint at night but come on, if this aint Amsterdam, I don't know what is!

Lets move on to the Light Festival!

### Light Festival

This one is a interesting one. It's made up of several screens that show a shot of lights flickering in the water.

Im *NOT* the one to untangle **THAT** mess!

Doesn't this remind you of a CD stad? But this one is probably taller than you!

There windows we're a funky little thing. We saw these during the day and wondered what they were. During the river cruise, we found out that they were a part of the Lights Festival.

Ah, the swans, my moms favourite. You really get a feel for their scale, with help from the car in the back

These lines were really funky! They  constantly collided and intertwinded themselves in a mesmorizing dance.

*MUSHROOM!,MUSHROOM!,MUSHROOM!*

## Rotterdam

### The MiniWorld
The miniworld is an awesome place to discover. They hide SOOOO many fun little easter eggs and details amongst the figurines and train tracks. Can you find all of the 
I've  been to the Firth of Forth bridge in real life!

Just look how big the main world is! And they have EVEN MORE in other rooms!

One day, I *WILL* drive one...

I believe this is the Miniworlds very own Haunted House. Or, at the very least, abandoned house.

ALL ABOARD!

Eery ten minutes, night falls and the world transforms

The Carnivals in town!

The controldeck for this whole world is SO BIG! Would love to learn how to manage it!

### Notable Buildings
The Cube Houses, which you can actually rent for a night!

And right beside the Cubes sits this funky Pipe-punk building.

This is  actually a covered market, probably one of the worlds largets indoor markets. An impressive structure! Of your hungry in Rotterdam, look no further! They have SO MUCH food in there!

It's a museum, we figured out, inside this flower pot of a building.

## Going Home
Okay, so I didn't go home by the Eurostar, but I'm so happy with my pic of it, I had to include it.

That's all from this post. Have a great rest of your day!
